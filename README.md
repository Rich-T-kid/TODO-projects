# TODO-projects
7. Database Query Optimizer Playground
* Browser or mobile app frontend to visualize query plans
* Backend in Go/Rust to:
    * Parse SQL
    * Convert to logical plan
    * Apply cost-based and rule-based optimizations
* Optional: Python notebooks to simulate queries with metrics
üß† Shows deep DB internals knowledge‚Ä®üìÇ Recruiters at infra/database companies will LOVE this


MINI projects (day long, just get the gist of the concept)
* Build Buffer pool 
* Write a join 
* Implement a B+ Tree
* Implement a skip list
* Implement K-way external merge
* Write a sql parser
* Write a logical planner from an sql query
* Write a logical to physical planner
* Implement a Write ahead log

4. Live Network Latency Visualizer Across Multiple Locations
üß© Like: a ‚ÄúPingMap‚Äù of server health
Features:
* Deploy ping agents to multiple cloud regions (EC2, fly.io, etc.)
* Central dashboard aggregates results
* Visualize latency and outages in a map or graph
* Optional: anomaly detection or alerting
Tech:
* Rust or Go agents
* Python FastAPI or Go backend
* Frontend: React/D3 or CLI (ASCII graphs)
Why it's üî•:
* Distributed, real-world use case
* Gives you a strong visual demo
* Teaches you about real-world latency and reliability


1. Distributed Job Queue with Retry, Backoff, and Deduplication
üß© Like: Sidekiq, BullMQ, or Celery ‚Äî but minimal and Go-based
Features:
* Job producer API (HTTP or gRPC)
* Redis/Kafka-based task queue
* Worker that executes jobs and retries with exponential backoff
* Dashboard (CLI or Web) for monitoring jobs
* Optional: add deduplication using hashes
* Optional: support for priorities or scheduling (run at X time)
Tech:
* Go + Redis or NATS
* Optional UI in Python/React
* Deploy via Docker Compose


Music Recommender from Lyrics + Tempo + Vibes
Scrape lyrics + audio metadata and build a hybrid content-based recommender.
* Use: Lyrics embedding (BERT) + tempo + mood metadata
* Build scoring function based on user listening habits
* Optional: audio fingerprinting or similarity graph
üß† Learn: hybrid recommender systems, music ML, cosine similarity‚Ä®üí• Fun and highly demoable
